I am an Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Student(B.Tech + M.Tech, 5-year program) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), pursuing M.Tech in Data Science and B.Tech in Civil Engineering. Currently, I am a Visiting Student Researcher at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/). My research on 3D thermal imaging is supervised by [Prof. Viswanath Saragadam](https://vishwa91.github.io/) and [Prof. Amit K Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit). 
As part of my M.Tech thesis at the [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/), IIT Madras, I work on 3D vision problems using event-based sensors under the supervision of [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/). 
I worked on an industry-academia research collaboration between [Continental Automotive](https://www.continental.com/en/) and the [Lab for Imaging Sciences and Algorithms (LISA)](http://lisa.ee.iisc.ac.in/) at IISc Bangalore. Guided by [Dr. Kunal Narayan Chaudhury](https://sites.google.com/site/kunalnchaudhury/home/), focusing on developing techniques for selective region-based low-light image enhancement.
I have also worked on fusing thermal and RGB images for traffic analysis under [Prof. Lelitha Devi Vanajakshi](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/faculty/lelitha/) and [Prof. Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan](https://sites.google.com/view/chandrashekar-lakshminarayanan) at IIT Madras. As a part of my B. Tech Thesis, I have worked on solving the problem of Traffic Signal Control using PINNs and Reinforcement Learning Approaches, under the guidance of [Prof. Lelitha Devi Vanajakshi](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/faculty/lelitha/) and [Dr. Chayan Banerjee](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/c.banerjee). 
I have worked on big data analysis of hard-braking events at [Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). This research was conducted under the guidance of [Prof. Darcy Bullock](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=2005).

**My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I am passionate about tackling challenges in 2D/3D computer vision (including multi-modal approaches and image processing) and applying reinforcement learning to solve complex decision-making problems in autonomous systems.**
